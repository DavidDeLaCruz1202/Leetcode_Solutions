# Leetcode_Solutions
**A repository with my solutions to various Leetcode problems**

## My process is usually:
1) **Read and understand a problem**
  - What is the problem asking for?
  - What data structures will likely be needed?
  - Are there any return values?
  - What are the problem's constraints?

2) **Attempt to solve it in a basic manner**
  - "If I had to solve this by hand / in real life, what would I do?"
  - What's the easiest way to solve it, without considering optimizations?
  - Comment **everywhere**, it's important to know what I was thinking at certain aspects of the code and what I'm **trying to do** so I know what to go for / what to not go for (if it didn't work).

3) **Debug where necessary**
  - Consider variable types and edge cases
  - I use `print()` statements everywhere to see what values are equal to what at runtime, and comapre them to what I expect / want
  - Are various parts working as intended?
  - What values / types of values can I expect to be where?

4) **Optimize the solution where I can, considering time and space complexities**
  - Are there any unnecessary amounts of searching or storing?
  - Can I use dictionaries or sets? (Generally faster than lists which is my go-to simple data structure)
  - Mostly an issue with data structures, large amounts of data require faster searches and such
